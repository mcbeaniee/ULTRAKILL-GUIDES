                    The boss of 0-1 is a soon-to-be familiar face, of the malicious variety. The MALICIOUS FACE, more commonly known to the community as a "Maurice", is an enemy easily felled with the skills
                    learned in 0-1. On any difficulty, PARRYING its red bullets back into its face and hitting it with a charged Piercer shot will almost always be enough to move on. If for whatever reason
                    it begins to charge its explosion death beam, you have two choices. Either: 1. get up close an personal and PARRY the beam by punching the Maurice in the face at the right time, or 2. jump,
                    dash, hop and skip arouond the arena as its target locks in shortly before firing, meaning that if you are moving fast enough you will not be caught in its blast.
                </P>

                    Alternatively, if you're looking for some flashy clips, you COULD (considering a repeat playthrough) CHARGEBACK the beam using a Marksman Revolver COIN, for some extra style points 
                    (literally and figuratively). Although if you are on a repeat playthrough, this boss can be simply and just as stylishly dispatched by a single point-blank shotgun blast and a bit of punching.
                    Altogether, this level should be a piece of cake and the level all players should strive to master if they have any hope of getting into speedrunning.
