                    0-2's title, THE MEATGRINDER, is a fairly accurate description. The player should be familiar with environmental hazards such as, well, meatgrinders from other games. If not,
                    this level will make you extremely  comfortable with them. Touch the hazards in the level, and you are instantly transformed into a cloud of red mist and blue microplastics.
                    Not fun! The first combat room (if you can even call it a room, it's more of a claustrophobic hallway) contains two STRAYS. If you followed our guide and used the pipe clip 
                    to skip most of 0-1, you will be unfamiliar with these enemies. Simply put, they shoot you. Once. and they are also incredibly cowardly! Their projectiles are easily PARRIED
                    and they die from one Piercer shot to the head, and pretty much anything else. Shoot the one in front of you, then parry the bullet of the one behind you back into his skull.

                    The next 2 rooms of 0-2 get you REAL familiar with being surrounded by enemies. The first consists of a fragile glass bridge placed precariously over aforementioned
                    MEATGRINDERS. After walking forward, four FILTH will spawn in front of you, and four will spawn behind you. As always, jumping to group them below you works to get an easy kill.
                    You can either ground slam to crush most of them, or by pre-charging a Piercer shot and breaking the glass below you to shred all the filth below you. Just be sure to dash onto the 
                    intact glass bridge. The next room is vertically limiting, but you will catch a glimpse of your future opponent through a door that closes faster than anyone has ever been able to reach it.
                    You will now be subject to a cocophony of FILTH and STRAYS lined up nice and orderly for a Piercer shot. On repeat playthroughs, a single CORE-NUKE will instantly obliterate all enemies in 
                    this room.

                    More hazards await you, but this time instead of wanting to turn you into sauce, they want to turn you (and thankfully, any enemy in their vicinity) into a pancake. After watchinig two FILTH get flattened. A large room with a giant piston in the middle will now greet you.
                    Speeding through this level TOO fast can see you flying through the door to this room and straight into the waffle press. Clearing this room is simple as long as you don't run into the pancake maker in the middle.
                    Through the door should now put you into a small piston gauntlet of sorts, where two strays will be instantly crushed upon entering. A single dash-jump timed correctly should safely get you to the next section. 
                    Now there are a few different ways you can go once you make it to this point. Theres a hole in the ceiling a few rooms back which contains a foreboding blue skull, which can be put 
                    on a pedestal through the door to your left. This unlocks... <strong>an</strong> exit. Alternatively, and preferably by most, going straight will put you in a small cage 
                    where you fight alongside our favorite yellow machined friend. You both battle a mix of STRAY and FILTH, both of which easily dispatched by charged Piercer shots and bullet PARRIES.

                    The last room of 0-2 is nothing to scoff at, for this stage of the game. Two crushers occupy the middle of this O-shaped room. The exit lies before you, but multiple STRAYS and hordes of 
                    FILTH will swarm you. Careful not to graze the hazards, the Sharpshooter revolver makes short work of this room. Now time for the MEAT, so to speak, of this level. 0-2, along with 0-1, are 
                    the only levels in the Prelude with 5 secrets. 0-2 has one more, mentioned earlier, which is incidentially where the first secret is. From the end of the level, there is one secret orb behind the blood waterfall towards the exit. It goes without
                    saying that these secrets should be acquired with utmost caution. The tunnel behind the bloodfall will also lead you to 2 other secrets, and going backwards in the level will send you to our first
                    RED secret orb, which gives you 200 overshield, but they are typically out of your way or actively harmful to try and obtain. this one specifically is only obtainable by dashing through a tunnel of
                    meatgrinders and crushers! watch your dash!

                    There is one more secret near the entrance, but be careful to not touch the fan. Additionally, you can fight our favorite yellow friend by breaking through to his side of the battle cages by backtracking after 
                    the final room. After a small hop over a blood river/hole in the floor, you can face a (admittedly tough, given the stage of the game) boss battle against our friend, SWORDSMACHINE. He has 250 health,
                    and for reference, a fully charged Piercer shot deals roughly 3 damage. He can be easily PARRIED, however, which will enrage him and, funnily enough, make him EASIER to PARRY. Upon defeating him, he will
                    drop the infamous Core Eject shotgun. This tool cannot be obtained until the next level normally, so having it early will make your run of the next level that much easier! Well, if we werent already about to cheese 
                    the ever loving fuck out of it, with slam storage. Onward!
